# Contributing

Everyone is welcome to contribute to project-elaichi, including adding new screens, fixing current issues or suggesting enhancements.

Please read the following sections before contributing:

- [Opening an Issue](#opening-an-issue)
- [Commits](#commits)
- [Creating A Pull Request](#creating-a-pull-request)
- [Style Guide](#style-guide)

## Opening an Issue

### New Feature/Feature Request

A new feature should have the `enhancement` label, with a title describing the new feature (“Add new screen for maps”).

If the feature is an UI improvement or a new screen, please provide a wireframe of the screen.

The issue message should explain what the feature is going to change in the app and possible conflicts (“The new endpoints will change the list item in the Home Screen”).

## Commits

- Write clear meaningful git commit messages (Do read <http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/>)
- Make sure your PR's description contains GitHub's special keyword references that automatically close the related issue when the PR is merged. (More info at <https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests> )
- When you make very very minor changes to a PR of yours (like for example fixing a failing travis build or some small style corrections or minor changes requested by reviewers) make sure you squash your commits afterwards so that you don't have an absurd number of commits for a very small fix. (Learn how to squash at <https://davidwalsh.name/squash-commits-git> )
- When you're submitting a PR for a UI-related issue, please try to add a screenshot of your change or a link to a deployment where it can be tested out along with your PR. This makes reviewing quick and easy for the reviewers.

## Issue or Bug

When filing a bug, please follow the [Github Issue Template Guideline](https://gist.github.com/auremoser/72803ba969d0e61ff070#file-issue_template-md)

## Creating a Pull Request

If you are going to work on an issue, please let us know that by commenting the issue page. We will then assign it to you.

When creating a Pull Request, please make sure your code follows the [Style Guide](#style-guide).

This project follows the [GitFlow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model) structure in the git tree, so when creating a new feature or fixing an issue, please create the appropriate branch from the `development` branch. When your feature is finished, merge it back into `development` and create your pull request.

Additionally, each commit message must follow this set of rules:

- Reference the issue that you are fixing/adding as a feature
- Explain what the commit does (“Fixes issue #1), “Adds a button to the bottom bar for ‘Home’”)
- Use the present tense (“Add feature” not “Added feature”)
- Use the imperative mood (“Move cursor to…” not “Moves cursor to…”)

## Style Guide

When creating a pull-request to the project-elaichi repo, you must:

- Format the code with  `dartfmt`
- Comment any added Functions and Methods according to the [Effective Dart: Documentation](https://www.dartlang.org/guides/language/effective-dart/documentation) for commenting code.
- Name variables and methods according to [Effective Dart: Design](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/design).
